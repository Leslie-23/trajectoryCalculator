# trajectoryCalculator
Console app for calculating the trajectory of an object given some few instances like velocity and distance.

# C++ Projectile Motion Visualization

This is a C++ program that simulates and visually displays the projectile motion of an object. The program calculates and visualizes the vertical motion of the projectile over time, making use of basic physics equations and ASCII art.

## Features

- Simulates the vertical motion of a projectile.
- Visualizes the trajectory with asterisks.
- Provides control over initial velocity, launch angle, and gravity.
- Allows you to adjust the time interval between steps for visualization.

 Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Leslie-23/trajectoryCalculator.git


   in this version all the data for calculation will need to in to the source file itself. But upgrades to come later on    :)
